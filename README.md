# Gratitude-Journal

This project is a SwiftUI app inspired by CodeWithChris’ “A Better Day” tutorial.
While the original app focused on general daily logging, this version has been redesigned into a Gratitude Journal — a simple space where users can pause, reflect, and write down the things they’re thankful for.
The flow and structure of the app remain similar to the tutorial, but the features and content have been tailored for gratitude journaling, including:
Journaling page to log daily gratitude entries.
Highlights section to capture the best moments of the day.
History page to revisit past gratitude logs and reflect on personal growth.
Settings for basic customization.
The goal of this app is to encourage positivity and mindfulness by helping users recognize and appreciate the little joys in their everyday life. 🌿✨
